# Meme Code: Problem Finder 😂

This is a joke program that humorously "searches" for problems but never finds any! Perfect for those debugging sessions where everything *should* work... but doesn't. 😆

## 🖥️ How It Works

This C++ program:
1. Prints "Searching for problems..."
2. Waits for 10 seconds (because searching takes time, right? ⏳)
3. Says "We didn't find any problems" (just like real debugging)
4. Waits for user input before closing

## 📜 Code
```cpp
#include <Windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    printf("Searching for problems...\n");
    Sleep(10000);
    printf("We didn't find any problems\n");

    system("PAUSE>0");
}
```

## 🛠️ Compilation & Execution
### Windows:
```sh
g++ -o ProblemFinder ProblemFinder.cpp
./ProblemFinder
```
Make sure you have MinGW installed if using `g++`!

### Visual Studio:
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Create a new Console App
3. Paste the code
4. Press **Ctrl + F5** to run

## 🤣 Meme-Worthy
This code is basically:
- When the IT guy looks at your PC and it suddenly works ✅
- When you debug for hours and find out it's just a missing semicolon 🧐

Enjoy the joke and happy coding! 🚀
